# Getting Started

## Overview

A comprehensive collection of async JavaScript patterns and implementations,
with TypeScript support and best practices.

## Installation

```bash:preview
git clone https://github.com/Underwood-Inc/async-mastery.git
cd async-mastery
npm install
```

## Quick Start

```typescript:preview
import { withRetry } from './patterns/auto-retry';
import { Memoizer } from './patterns/memoization';

// Example: Fetch data with retry and caching
const api = new Memoizer({
  maxAge: 60000,
  maxSize: 100,
});

const fetchData = async (id: string) => {
  return api.memoize(
    () =>
      withRetry(
        async () => {
          const response = await fetch(`/api/data/${id}`);
          return response.json();
        },
        { maxAttempts: 3 }
      ),
    id
  );
};
```

## Pattern Categories

### Promise Implementations

- [Custom Promise](../implementations/custom-promise.md) - Build your own Promise from scratch
- [Promise.all()](../implementations/promise-all.md) - Parallel execution with all promises
- [Promise.any()](../implementations/promise-any.md) - Race to first success
- [Promise.race()](../implementations/promise-race.md) - Race to first completion
- [Promise.allSettled()](../implementations/promise-allsettled.md) - Wait for all completions
- [Promise.finally()](../implementations/promise-finally.md) - Guaranteed execution
- [Promise.resolve/reject](../implementations/promise-resolve-reject.md) - Static promise creation

### Task Management

- [Tasks in Series](../patterns/tasks-series.md) - Sequential execution
- [Tasks in Parallel](../patterns/tasks-parallel.md) - Concurrent execution
- [Tasks Racing](../patterns/tasks-race.md) - Competitive execution

### Timer Control

- [Custom setTimeout](../timers/settimeout.md) - Enhanced timeout implementation
- [Custom setInterval](../timers/setinterval.md) - Enhanced interval implementation
- [Clear All Timers](../timers/clear-timers.md) - Timer management

### Rate Control

- [Auto-Retry](../advanced/auto-retry.md) - Automatic failure recovery
- [Batch Throttling](../advanced/batch-throttling.md) - Group API calls
- [Debouncing](../advanced/debouncing.md) - Delay until settled
- [Throttling](../advanced/throttling.md) - Rate limiting
- [Memoization](../advanced/memoization.md) - Result caching

## Best Practices

### Code Quality

- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Extensive testing
- Environment-specific optimizations

### Pattern Selection Guide

- When to use each pattern
- Pattern combinations
- Common pitfalls
- Performance considerations
- Error handling strategies
