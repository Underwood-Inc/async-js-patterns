# Memory Management

## Overview

Effective memory management is crucial for maintaining performance and stability in long-running applications. This section covers strategies to prevent memory leaks and optimize memory usage in JavaScript applications.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Garbage Collection

JavaScript engines automatically manage memory through garbage collection. However, developers must ensure that objects are no longer referenced when they are no longer needed.

### 2. Memory Leaks

Common causes of memory leaks include:

- Unintentionally retained references
- Forgotten event listeners
- Closures that capture unnecessary data

### Real-World Example

Consider a web application that processes large datasets. Proper memory management ensures that memory is released after processing, preventing leaks.

```typescript:preview
class DataProcessor {
  private data: any[];

  constructor(data: any[]) {
    this.data = data;
  }

  process() {
    // Process data
    this.data = null; // Release memory
  }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Unintentional Global Variables**

```typescript:preview
// ❌ Bad: Creates a global variable
function processData() {
  data = fetchData();
}

// ✅ Good: Use local variables
function processData() {
  const data = fetchData();
}
```

2. **Forgotten Event Listeners**

```typescript:preview
// ❌ Bad: Event listener not removed
element.addEventListener('click', handler);

// ✅ Good: Remove event listener when no longer needed
element.removeEventListener('click', handler);
```

## Best Practices

1. Use WeakMap and WeakSet for managing object references that can be garbage collected when no longer needed.
2. Regularly profile memory usage to identify and fix leaks.
3. Avoid creating unnecessary closures that capture large objects.
